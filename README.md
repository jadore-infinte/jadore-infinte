# HIII

My name is Tarek. I'm from Syria, and I like computers and stuff.

I'm a beginner programmer learning full-stack web development.  
My goal is to one day make my own operating system! (ik it's ambitious but whatever)

## Things I like:
- anime  
- cats  
- Syria  
- history  
- computers  
- coding  

That's all, byee!
